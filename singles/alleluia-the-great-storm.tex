cried a^{C}loud in her ^{G}fright. \\

the ^{C}powers of ^{D}hell.

\begin{verse}
^{$\uparrow$}Sweetness in the air, \& justice on the wind, \\
laughter in the house \\
where the mourners had been. \\
The deaf shall have music, \\
the blind have new eyes, \\
the standards of death \\
taken down by surprise.
\end{verse}

\chorusref{Chorus}

\begin{verse}
Release for the captives, \& end to the wars, \\
new streams in the desert, \\
new hope for the poor. \\
The little lame children \\
will dance as they sing, \\
and play with the bears \\
and the lions in spring.
\end{verse}

\chorusref{Chorus}

\begin{verse}
Hush little baby, let go of your fear. \\
The Lord loves his own \\
and your mother is here. \\
The child fell asleep as the lantern did burn, \\
the mother sang on \\
till her bridegroom's return.
