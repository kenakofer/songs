\begin{verse}
Oh ^{Em}{all the} ^{Cadd2}money that ^{G}e'er I ^{D}spent \\
I ^{G}spent it in good company. ^{D} \\
And ^{Em}{all the} ^{Cadd2}harm that ^{G}e'er I've ^{D}done, \\
^{G/D}{alas, it} ^{G}was to ^{Em}none but ^{C}me. \\
\\
And ^{G}all I've done for want of wit, \\
to ^{Am}memory ^{D}now, I ^{G}can't re^{D}call. \\
So ^{Em}fill to ^{C}me the ^{G}parting ^{D}glass. \\
^{G/D}Goodnight and ^{G}joy be ^{Em}with you ^{C}all. \\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Oh ^{Em}{all the} ^{Cadd2}comrades that ^{G}e'er I've ^{D}had \\
are ^{G}sorry for my going away. ^{D} \\
And ^{Em}{all the} ^{Cadd2}sweethearts that ^{G}e'er I've ^{D}had, \\
^{G/D}{would wish} me ^{G}one more ^{Em}day to ^{C}stay. \\
\\
But ^{G}since it falls unto my lot, \\
that ^{Am}{I should} ^{D}rise and ^{G}you should ^{D}not, \\
I'll ^{Em}gently ^{C}rise and I'll ^{G}softly ^{D}call \\
^{G/D}Goodnight and ^{G}joy be ^{Em}with you ^{C}all. \\
\end{verse}
