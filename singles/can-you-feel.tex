\begin{verse}
^{C}There's a calm sur^{G/B}render \\
^{C}to the rush of ^{G/B}day, \\
^{C}when the heat of a ^{G/B}rolling wind \\
^{Am7}can be turned a^{D}way. \\
^{C}An enchanted ^{G/B}moment, \\
^{C}and it sees me ^{G/B}through. \\
^{C}It's enough for this ^{Em}restless warrior \\
^{F}Just to be with ^{D}you. \\
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
And ^{G}can you fe^{D}{el the} lo^*{Em}{ve toni} ^{C}ght? ^{G} \\
It is ^{C}where ^{A}we ^{D}are. ^{C} \\
It's enough ^{G} for this ^*{Em}wide- ^{G}eyed ^{C}wanderer \\
^{Am}that ^{G}we ^{C}got ^{A}this fa^{D}r. \\
And ^{G}can you fe^{D}{el the} lo^*{Em}{ve toni} ^{C}ght? ^{G} \\
How it's ^{C}laid ^{A}to ^{D}rest? ^{C} \\
It's enough ^{G} to make ^{Em}kings ^{G}and ^{C}vagabonds \\
be^{Am}lieve ^{G}the ^{C/G}very be^{G}st.

\begin{verse}
^{$\uparrow$}There's a time for everyone, \\
if they only learn \\
that the twisting kaleidoscope \\
moves us all in turn. \\
There's a rhyme and reason \\
to the wild outdoors. \\
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager \\
beats in time with yours.
